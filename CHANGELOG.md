    - GO-2025-3595: Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in html package
    - GO-2025-3503: HTTP Proxy bypass using IPv6 Zone IDs
    - GO-2024-3333: Non-linear parsing vulnerability in html package
  - Updated `golang.org/x/crypto` from v0.21.0 to v0.36.0
  - Updated `golang.org/x/sys` from v0.18.0 to v0.31.0
  - Updated `golang.org/x/text` from v0.14.0 to v0.23.0
- Updated Go toolchain from 1.20 to 1.23.0 with Go 1.24.4 for enhanced security

### Added
- Official Azure Cloud Adoption Framework documentation mapping for 55 resources
- New nested `official` object structure containing Azure CAF documentation attributes
- Comprehensive official resource provider namespace mappings
- GitHub Copilot Agent firewall configuration for improved CI/CD testing
- Enhanced resource validation and testing framework
- Comprehensive CI testing pipeline with resource validation, matrix testing, and coverage analysis
- Advanced Makefile targets for comprehensive testing (`test_ci`, `test_ci_fast`, `test_ci_complete`)
- Shared testing utilities to reduce code duplication (SonarQube compliance)
- Refactored naming convention tests to use centralized test helpers

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Consolidated `resourceDefinition.json` and `resourceDefinition_out_of_docs.json` into single unified file
- **BREAKING**: Refactored JSON structure to nest official Azure CAF attributes under `official` object
- Updated resource definitions to include proper Azure CAF documentation mapping for key resources:
  - API Management service instance (`apim`) - Microsoft.ApiManagement/service
  - AKS cluster (`aks`) - Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters
  - Container apps (`ca`) - Microsoft.App/containerApps
  - Application gateway (`agw`) - Microsoft.ApplicationGateway/applicationGateways
  - Virtual network (`vnet`) - Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks
  - Storage account (`st`) - Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts
  - And 49 additional resources with official mappings
- Simplified resource definition structure for non-official resources (only `resource` field in `official` object)
- Enhanced code generation logic to handle nested official attributes
- Updated documentation and contribution guidelines to reflect new structure

### Fixed
- DNS blocking issues with `checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com` during integration tests
- Resource provider namespace accuracy for officially documented Azure resources
- Resource generation and validation processes for unified file structure

### Removed
- `resourceDefinition_out_of_docs.json` file (consolidated into main file)
- Legacy flat structure for official documentation attributes

## Migration Guide

### For Contributors
- Use the new nested `official` object structure when adding or modifying resources
- Resources in official Azure CAF documentation should include `slug`, `resource`, and `resource_provider_namespace` in the `official` object
- Resources not in official documentation should only include the `resource` field in the `official` object

### For Consumers
- The root-level `slug` field remains unchanged for backward compatibility
- New official documentation data is available through the `official` object
- No breaking changes to existing provider functionality

## Statistics
- **Total Resources**: 395 (previously 364 + 31 across two files)
- **Official Azure CAF Mappings**: 55 resources with complete official documentation data
- **Non-Official Resources**: 340 resources with simplified official structure
- **Files Consolidated**: 2 â†’ 1 resource definition file
